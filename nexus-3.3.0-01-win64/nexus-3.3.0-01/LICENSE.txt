Sonatype does not warrant that Customer's use of the Insight Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor does Sonatype warrant that it will review the Customer Data for accuracy or that it will preserve or maintain the Customer Data without loss.  Sonatype's sole liability (and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty shall be, in Sonatype's sole discretion and at no charge to Customer, to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with an error correction or work-around that corrects the reported non-conformity, or if Sonatype determines such remedies to be impracticable, to allow Customer to terminate the Subscription Term and receive as its sole remedy a refund of: (a) the monthly subscription fees specified in the applicable Order Form which are allocable to the thirty (30) day period prior to the date the warranty claim was made and (b) any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of Insight Service or related services it has not received as of the date of the warranty claim.

Sonatype's sole liability (and Customer's exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty shall be, in Sonatype's sole discretion, to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with an error-correction or work-around which corrects the reported non-conformity, to replace the non-conforming Sonatype Software with conforming Sonatype Software, or if Sonatype determines such remedies to be impracticable within a reasonable period of time, to allow the Customer to terminate the Subscription Term and receive as its sole remedy a refund of the Subscription fee paid for the non-conforming Sonatype Software. Sonatype shall have no obligation with respect to a warranty claim unless notified of such claim within the Sonatype Software Warranty Period. The limited warranty set forth in this Section 12.2 shall not apply: (i) if the Sonatype Software is used with hardware or software not specified in the Documentation; (ii) if any modifications are made to the Sonatype Software by Customer or any third party; (iii) to defects in the Sonatype Software due to accident, abuse or improper use by Customer; or (iv) items provided on a no charge or evaluation basis.

Customer should independently review each Open Source Software component and applicable license Customer is considering using within Customer's environment or in any product or service.  In addition, Reports may refer to the terms of certain Open Source Software licenses but these Reports do not constitute legal advice or guidance.  Customer should read each Open Source Software license in full and consult with an attorney regarding the meaning of any Open Source Software license.
13.	Limitation of Remedies and Damages.
13.1	NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.

Sonatype shall indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any claim of infringement of a U.S. patent, U.S. copyright, or U.S. trademark asserted against Customer by a third party based upon Customer's use of the Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided that Sonatype shall have received from Customer: (i) prompt notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Sonatype to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer. If Customer's use of any of the Product is, or in Sonatype's opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the type of infringement specified above, or if required by settlement, Sonatype may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute for the Product substantially functionally similar programs and documentation; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Product; or if (a) and (b) are commercially impracticable, (c) terminate the Agreement and refund to Customer the pro-rata portion of the Subscription fees paid by Customer allocable to the unused remainder of the Subscription Term.  The foregoing indemnification obligation of Sonatype shall not apply: (1) if the Product is modified by any party other than Sonatype, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (2) the Product is combined with other non-Sonatype products or process not authorized by Sonatype, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of the Product; (4) to any claim that arose as a result of any Customer Data; (5) to any unsupported release of the Product; or (6) to any Open Source Software or other third-party code contained within the Product or delivered as a part of the Subscription. THIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH SONATYPE'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.
15.	Confidential Information. Each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains ("Receiving Party") from the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any services, software, documentation or technical information provided by Sonatype (or its agents), performance information relating to the Product, Service, the Sonatype Materials and the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Sonatype without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (a) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (b) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (c) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (d) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or (e) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
