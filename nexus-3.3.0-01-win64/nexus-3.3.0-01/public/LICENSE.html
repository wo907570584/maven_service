Sonatype shall indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any claim of infringement of a U.S. patent, U.S. copyright, or U.S. trademark asserted against Customer by a third party based upon Customer's use of the Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided that Sonatype shall have received from Customer: (i) prompt notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Sonatype to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer. If Customer's use of any of the Product is, or in Sonatype's opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the type of infringement specified above, or if required by settlement, Sonatype may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute for the Product substantially functionally similar programs and documentation; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Product; or if (a) and (b) are commercially impracticable, (c) terminate the Agreement and refund to Customer the pro-rata portion of the Subscription fees paid by Customer allocable to the unused remainder of the Subscription Term.  The foregoing indemnification obligation of Sonatype shall not apply: (1) if the Product is modified by any party other than Sonatype, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (2) the Product is combined with other non-Sonatype products or process not authorized by Sonatype, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of the Product; (4) to any claim that arose as a result of any Customer Data; (5) to any unsupported release of the Product; or (6) to any Open Source Software or other third-party code contained within the Product or delivered as a part of the Subscription. THIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH SONATYPE'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.

<h2>15. Confidential Information.</h2>
Each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains (<strong>"Receiving Party"</strong>) from the disclosing party (<strong>"Disclosing Party"</strong>) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (<strong>"Confidential Information"</strong>), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any services, software, documentation or technical information provided by Sonatype (or its agents), performance information relating to the Product, Service, the Sonatype Materials and the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Sonatype without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (a) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (b) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (c) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (d) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or (e) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
